### Hi there, I'm Anders Arnold!

I’m a final-year Computer Science student at IIT (ISM) Dhanbad, primarily focused on Software Engineering and system-level development. I’m passionate about building fast, reliable, and scalable systems—both in traditional backend engineering and in performance-critical domains like low-latency trading systems.

Currently:
- Working on quant-oriented, low-latency development projects
- Actively contributing to a quant finance cohort 
- Sharpening my backend, web, and app development skills
- Exploring blockchain dev and dipping into quantum computing when time permits

I strongly believe in the power of **open source** — not just as a way to give back, but as a platform to sharpen my skills and collaborate with developers worldwide. I’m working toward becoming a regular contributor to meaningful open-source projects.

#### Technical Interests:
- Scalable backend development | Distributed Systems | System Design
- Quantitative Finance | Low-Latency Architecture | ML/AI (Applied)
- Web & Mobile Development | Blockchain | Quantum Computing (Exploratory)

Feel free to check out my pinned repositories or reach out—always happy to connect and collaborate!
